# Swiggy-MYSQL-Analysis-Project

## Overview

This project aims to extract insights from Swiggy's SQL dataset using sophisticated SQL queries with intricate joins for in-depth analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Dataset

[Swiggy SQL Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S32wPjwNUlhi2G5xiW3_wZvGVKipJq-b/view)

The dataset includes information about customers, restaurants, orders, ratings, and delivery partners.

## Queries

The analysis involves executing the following SQL queries:

1. **Display all customers who live in 'Delhi'.**
2. **Find the average rating of all restaurants in 'Mumbai'.**
3. **List all customers who have placed at least one order.**
4. **Display the total number of orders placed by each customer.**
5. **Find the total revenue generated by each restaurant.**
6. **Find the top 5 restaurants with the highest average rating.**
7. **Display all customers who have never placed an order.**
8. **Find the number of orders placed by each customer in 'Mumbai'.**
9. **Display all orders placed in the last 30 days.**
10. **Find the customers who have placed orders on exactly three different days.**

*For the complete SQL queries, please refer to the attached PDF document in the project repository.*

## MySQL Features Used

The following MySQL features were utilized to execute the queries:

- **SELECT Statement**: To retrieve specific columns and data from the database.
- **WHERE Clause**: To filter records based on specified conditions.
- **JOIN Operations**: To combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, enabling comprehensive analysis.
- **GROUP BY**: To aggregate data across multiple records, facilitating calculations like averages and totals.
- **HAVING Clause**: To filter groups based on aggregate functions, ensuring accurate analysis of grouped data.
- **COUNT() Function**: To count the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- **AVG() Function**: To calculate the average of a specified column.
- **DATE Functions**: To manipulate and filter date values for time-based queries.
- **DISTINCT Keyword**: To return unique values from a column, useful for identifying unique customers or orders.
